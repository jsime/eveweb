The scripts in this directory are used to extract a variety of static
data from CCP's database dumps (SDE; Static Data Exports). They rely
on a PostgreSQL instance running with a fully loaded copy of the PG
conversion of CCP's SDE (since CCP only provides SQL Server, MySQL,
and flat files).

The scripts should be run in the numerical order of their names, as
some depend on the existence of data loaded by previous scripts.

They are safe to run against an existing EVEWeb database with static
data already loaded. This is useful in cases of SDE updates from CCP
add new items, skills, etc.

For your convenience, a run_import.sh shell script is provided here
that will run all the scripts in order for you.
